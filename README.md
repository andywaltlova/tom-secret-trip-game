# Tom's secret trip ✈️ - website with hidden flags 

Only purpose of this website was to hide few flags which together reveal secret destination of trip I planned.

* Backed - Sqlite + Flask 🐍 + gunicorn
* Frontend - Templates
* Deployed on Heroku

Some flags are hidden better than the others. Example of flag can be seen on homepage https://www.tom-secret-expedition.com/ , it was date related, since that date already passed it is now visible. Format of each flag is `FLAG-10: xxxxx`.
